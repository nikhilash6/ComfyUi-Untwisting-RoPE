# Unofficial Extensions

These options are experimental extensions and are not part of the original Untwisting RoPE paper.

## `adain_on_v`

Extends AdaIN alignment from attention `Q/K` to also include `V`.

This can help ensure that the final image has a color scheme similar to that of the reference image.

## `post_attention_adain`

 Matches the target attention output statistics to the reference attention output.

This is borrowed from the [feature-injection idea in ConsiStory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03286).

Unlike ConsiStory, this implementation does not use masks or spatial correspondence maps. It uses a simpler global AdaIN match.
